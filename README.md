# Bloc-Jams
This was the first project we had to do using JS, HTML/CSS.
After finishing all the fundamentals of frontend through codecademy, codeschool, etc. We now had to start our first project.

## First impressions
When I first started this project everything seemed very straightforward and easy to follow. But once I started to see all the chained methods and functions, all the connections to each object or array got a little overwhelming. I did have to write a flowchart for myself to understand what certain functions did. In the end it all worked out.

## Aftermath
Spent a lot of time on this project, I still feel like there is some things to improve. Such as adding more functionality to the app, mute buttons, login screens. All in all I learned a ton of JS here.
